# TranSliM
Depth integrated modelling of submarine landslide with weak layer using stagged mesh scheme.
2D shallow water equations are solved.
# Soil model
VM model with strain softening.
# Water drag
Drag coefficient are sonsidered, referring to Norem H, Locat J, Schieldrop B (1990) An approach to the physics and the modelling of submarine flowslides. Marine Georesources & Geotechnology, 9(2): 93â€“111.
Water-soil interaction and lubrication are not considered.
